   <h1>ABSOLUTE POSITIONING</h1>
   <p>Elements that are relatively positioned remain in the normal flow of the document</p>
   <p  class="positioned">In contrast, an element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is 
       positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static).</p>
   <p>The absolutely positioned element is positioned
            relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static)</p>
    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this 
                one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="./img4.jpg"></p>
   <p>This can be used to create a "floating" element that
        stays in the same position regardless of scrolling.
        In the example below, box "One" is fixed at 80 pixels from the top of the page and 10 pixels from the left.
         Even after scrolling, it remains in the same place relative to the viewport.This can be used to create a "floating"

          <p>Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, 
              with the exception that the element's containing block is the initial
               containing block established by the viewport, unless any ancestor has transform, perspective, or 
               filter property set to something other than none (see CSS Transforms Spec), which then causes that ancestor
                to take the place of the elements containing block. This can be used to create a "floating" element that stays 
                in the same position regardless of scrolling. In the example below, box "One" is fixed at 80 pixels from the top
